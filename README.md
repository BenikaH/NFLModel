# NFLModel
This is a term project that I worked on for my CS 598 programming languages class. NFLModel makes predictions on the likelihood of a play being made based off of down, distance, and field position as well as models games between two teams.

Note that a lot of assumptions were made when making this and isn't incredibly accurate.
